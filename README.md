# Document-Image-Extraction-repo
This repo offers a single-file Streamlit app (app.py) that extracts images from PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, and HTML. It can optionally use Google Gemini (GenAI) to generate natural-language descriptions of figures, charts, and diagrams by analyzing surrounding context, combining parsing with AI insight.
